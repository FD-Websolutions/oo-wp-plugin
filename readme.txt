Integrate real estates, contact forms and contact persons from the onOffice Software into your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Integrate real estates, contact forms and contact persons from the onOffice Software into your website. Thanks to shortcodes, the plugin is compatible with every WordPress theme.

The plugin includes three modules:
* real estates
* addresses
* forms

Using a short code, you bring real estates, addresses or forms to your website - you are as flexible in design as you are used to from onOffice.

The user-friendly plugin enables a quick link between onOffice and your WordPress page: Present real estate and your team on the website and generate leads via forms. You stay in control and are 100% flexible.

= Real estate =
Create lists, design the real estate presentation and offer synopsis for downloading with a few easy steps.

* **Publication**: One click in the software is enough to publish the property on your WordPress website.
* **List view**: Present your properties in clear lists. It is entirely up to you which properties are represented. The lists can be inserted anywhere on the website using short codes.
* **Detailed view**: Comfortably structure the detail view with checkboxes and drag&drop and easily determine which information is displayed.

= Addresses =
The website is your business card on the internet. Create trust with a professional self-presentation.
* **Team presentation**: The address module accesses the data of the employees. The address display is ideal for presenting the team.

= Forms =
Simplify data maintenance: The information from forms is automatically transmitted to onOffice by the plugin.

* **Contact**: Classic contact form in which the user enters his message and contact information.
* **Interested parties**: Proactively serve prospective customers! The prospective customer states the contact data and their search desire. Address and search criteria are created directly in onOffice and provided with suitable offers.
* **Owner**: Acquire new orders with your website! In addition to the contact details, the owner provides information about the property. Address and property can be processed immediately in onOffice.
* **Search for interested parties**: Convince potential sellers! Show that you have suitable prospects in your inventory. The interested parties are displayed together with the search criteria (but without personal data).

= Further features =
The plugin offers further practical functions with which you can further professionalize your web presence.

* User-friendly watch list or favorites function
* Two card types: OpenStreetMap or Google Maps
* Show all linked media per address / property
